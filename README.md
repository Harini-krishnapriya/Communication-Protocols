## Fundamentals of Design Verification

There are three types of signals in a design. They are:
1. Global signals: Signals that are visiable to the entire design,e.g CLK, RST signals.
2. Data signals: Signals that hold some data, e.g rdata, wdata
3. Control signals: Signals that control various operations.
